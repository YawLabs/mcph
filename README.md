# @yawlabs/mcph

One install. All your MCP servers. Managed from the cloud.

mcph is an MCP server that fronts every other MCP server you use. Install it once per AI client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code) and your servers come from your [mcp.hosting](https://mcp.hosting) account instead of a hand-edited `mcpServers` block. It earns its keep when you hit any of these:

- **More than one client or more than one machine.** Add a server once on the dashboard; every client/device picks it up on the next poll. No copy-paste of the same JSON into four config files, no per-machine drift.
- **Tool-context bloat.** The `dispatch` meta-tool ranks your installed servers against the task at hand and loads only the top match(es). A 30-server account stays at a handful of tools in context at any moment instead of surfacing hundreds by default.
- **API tokens you'd rather not sit in disk configs.** Credentials live encrypted on mcp.hosting and inject at spawn time. Rotate once — every client picks up the new value. Revoke the mcp.hosting token and every install stops working.
- **A trust signal before you activate.** Every scored server renders with its A–F compliance grade in `discover`. Set `MCPH_MIN_COMPLIANCE=B` to refuse anything below.

If you use one client on one machine with a handful of servers, `claude mcp add` or hand-editing `mcp.json` is fine — mcph's value shows up when that setup stops scaling.

## How it works

```
Your MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
    |
    |  single stdio connection
    v
@yawlabs/mcph
    |         |         |
    v         v         v
  GitHub    Slack    Stripe     ← your MCP servers (local or remote)
```

1. You add servers on [mcp.hosting](https://mcp.hosting) (name, command, args, env vars)
2. mcph pulls your config on startup
3. You use a handful of meta-tools to control which servers' tools are loaded in the current session:
   - **`mcp_connect_dispatch`** — describe a task in plain English; mcph picks the right server, loads its tools, and exposes them. The fast path when you know what you want.
   - **`mcp_connect_discover`** — list all installed servers, optionally ranked by relevance to a context string. Auto-loads the top match when one server clearly wins.
   - **`mcp_connect_activate`** — load specific servers' tools by namespace.
   - **`mcp_connect_deactivate`** — unload a server and remove its tools from context.
   - **`mcp_connect_install`** — install a new MCP server on your mcp.hosting account.
   - **`mcp_connect_import`** — bulk-import servers from an existing client config (`claude_desktop_config.json`, `mcp.json`, etc.).
   - **`mcp_connect_health`** — show call counts, error rates, and latency per loaded server.
   - **`mcp_connect_suggest`** — surface recurring multi-server workflows mcph has learned from persisted pack history. When you repeatedly use `gh` → `linear` → `slack` for the same kind of task, `suggest` lists the pattern with a ready-to-run `activate` call so you can load the whole pack at once.
   - **`mcp_connect_read_tool`** — return a single tool's schema + docs without activating its server. Reads 1–2 schemas instead of loading a whole catalog when the model only needs a couple of tools from a big server.
   - **`mcp_connect_exec`** — run a short declarative pipeline of tool calls in one round-trip. Steps name namespaced tools + args; `{"$ref": "<stepId>[.path]"}` markers splice prior outputs into later inputs. No eval — only dot/bracket path resolution. Capped at 16 steps.
   - **`mcp_connect_bundles`** — list curated multi-server presets (DevOps incident, PR review, growth stack, data ops, etc.) and/or match them against your current config. Pair it with `mcp_connect_activate` to load a whole bundle at once.

Installing a server puts it on your account; loading it brings its tools into the current session's context. mcph loads servers lazily so your context window stays clean.

Ranking is two-stage when the backend has a Voyage embeddings key configured: a local BM25 pass narrows to a shortlist, then a `/api/connect/rerank` call semantically reorders. With no key on the backend it gracefully degrades to BM25-only — `dispatch` and `discover(context)` keep working, just with slightly weaker ranking on ambiguous queries.

On top of the ranker, mcph applies three client-side signals to dispatch scores:

- **Health-aware**: servers that have recently failed to load or have high error rates get down-ranked. Never boosts above raw — "all else equal, prefer the one that works".
- **Learning**: servers that have succeeded before get a small (+10% max) nudge, so the router remembers what's been useful. Success counts persist across restarts via `~/.mcph/state.json` (opt out with `MCPH_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE=1`).
- **Sampling tiebreak**: when the top two candidates are within 10% of each other and your client supports [MCP sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/server/sampling), mcph asks your client's LLM to pick. Uses the model you're already running — no extra provider key, no extra cost to mcph.

## Install

### One command (recommended)

```bash
npx -y @yawlabs/mcph install <claude-code|claude-desktop|cursor|vscode> --token mcp_pat_your_token_here
```

This:

1. Edits the chosen client's config file (correct path for your OS, correct JSON shape) to launch mcph.
2. Writes your token to `~/.mcph/config.json` so every other client you install picks it up automatically — no need to copy the token into each client's `env` block.
3. On Windows, wraps `npx` in `cmd /c` (without this, MCP clients hit `ENOENT` on the `npx.cmd` shim).

Run it once per client. To rotate the token later, run `install` again with `--token` — both files get rewritten.

Helpful flags:

- `--scope user|project|local` — which file to write (Claude Code + Cursor support project/local; VS Code is workspace-only; Claude Desktop is user-only).
- `--dry-run` — print the diff and exit without writing.
- `--force` / `--skip` — overwrite or leave an existing `mcp.hosting` entry. Without either, mcph prompts (TTY) or refuses (non-TTY).
- `--no-mcph-config` — write only the client config; leave `~/.mcph/config.json` untouched.

Or install into every detected client at once:

```bash
mcph install --list                       # read-only: detect clients + show install state per scope
mcph install --all --token mcp_pat_…     # one-shot: install into every user-scope client on this machine
```

`--list` never writes (no token needed). `--all` installs into every client whose user-scope target is resolvable on this OS — Claude Desktop is skipped on Linux, VS Code is skipped unless `--project-dir` is given (it's workspace-only). Aggregate exit code is non-zero if any sub-install fails.

Or [edit the JSON by hand](#manual-install) if you'd rather.

### Diagnose problems — `mcph doctor`

```bash
npx -y @yawlabs/mcph doctor          # human-readable report
npx -y @yawlabs/mcph doctor --json   # machine-readable snapshot for pipelines
```

Prints the loaded config files, your token's source + fingerprint (last 4 chars), the API base URL, installed clients, env overrides, persisted learning state, flaky-namespace reliability rollup, shell-history "shadow" hits (CLIs you run that an MCP server could replace), and an upgrade check against the npm registry. Exits `0` healthy / `1` no token / `2` warnings (e.g. world-readable token file). Paste the text output into a support ticket; the `--json` blob is the same data as a structured snapshot, so dashboards and CI scripts can `jq` instead of parsing the text layout.

### Other CLI subcommands

```bash
mcph servers [<namespace-filter>] [--json]    # list servers; optional substring filter on namespace
mcph bundles [list|match] [--json]    # browse curated multi-server bundles (PR review, DevOps incident, etc.)
mcph reset-learning                   # clear cross-session learning history (~/.mcph/state.json)
mcph completion <bash|zsh|fish|powershell>   # print shell completion script
mcph upgrade [--run] [--json]         # show (or execute) the command that bumps @yawlabs/mcph
mcph compliance <target> [--publish]  # run the compliance suite against an MCP server
mcph --version                        # print version
```

Every CLI that reads state has a `--json` mode for pipeline use. `mcph servers` hits the backend; `mcph bundles list` and `mcph completion` are fully static (no network, no token). `mcph bundles match` partitions the curated set against your enabled servers so you see the same ready-to-activate vs. partially-installed view the LLM-facing `mcp_connect_bundles` meta-tool produces.

To wire up shell completion:

```bash
# bash
mcph completion bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/mcph

# zsh (must be on $fpath, then rebuild compinit)
mcph completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_mcph"

# fish
mcph completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/mcph.fish

# powershell
mcph completion powershell >> $PROFILE
```

### Getting your token

1. Sign up at [mcp.hosting](https://mcp.hosting)
2. Go to **Settings > API Tokens**
3. Create a token — it starts with `mcp_pat_`
4. Pass it to `mcph install` as shown above

### Manual install

If you'd rather edit the config files yourself, the JSON shapes are:

**Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop** — top-level key `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp.hosting": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@yawlabs/mcph"]
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code** — top-level key `servers` (NOT `mcpServers`) in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mcp.hosting": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@yawlabs/mcph"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows** — `command: "cmd", args: ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@yawlabs/mcph"]` (the `cmd /c` wrapper is required because `npx.cmd` is a shim).

Then put your token in `~/.mcph/config.json` so mcph picks it up at startup:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "token": "mcp_pat_your_token_here"
}
```

Or set `MCPH_TOKEN` in the client's `env` block — both work.

## Adding servers

On [mcp.hosting](https://mcp.hosting), add each MCP server you want to orchestrate:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display name (e.g., "GitHub") |
| **Namespace** | Short prefix for tool names (e.g., "gh") |
| **Type** | `local` (stdio) or `remote` (HTTP) |
| **Command** | For local: the command to run (e.g., "npx") |
| **Args** | For local: command arguments (e.g., ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]) |
| **Env** | Environment variables (API keys, tokens) |
| **URL** | For remote: the server URL |

## Usage

### Fast path — `dispatch`

When you know what you want to do, skip the discover/load dance:

```
> Create a GitHub issue for the login bug

[mcp_connect_dispatch is called with intent="create a GitHub issue for the login bug"]

Dispatched "create a GitHub issue for the login bug" — loaded top 1 of 1 matching server.
gh (score 4.32): Loaded "gh" — 24 tools: gh_create_issue, gh_list_prs, ...

[gh_create_issue is then called, returns the new issue]
```

`dispatch` ranks every installed server, loads the top match's tools, and immediately exposes them so the LLM can call them. Default budget is 1 (one server). For tasks that need multiple servers, pass `budget: 3` etc.

### Manual control

```
> What MCP servers do I have?

Installed MCP servers:

  gh — GitHub [ready] (local)
  slack — Slack [ready] (local)
  stripe — Stripe [ready] (local)

0 loaded in this session, 0 tools in context.
```

```
> Load my GitHub server

Loaded "gh" — 24 tools: gh_create_issue, gh_list_prs, ...
```

You can load multiple at once: `> Load GitHub and Slack`. Tools are namespaced as `{namespace}_{original_tool_name}` to prevent collisions. The tool list updates automatically via `tools/list_changed`.

```
> Unload GitHub when you're done

Unloaded "gh". Tools removed from context.
```

Servers also auto-unload after ~10 tool calls to other servers, so context stays clean even if you forget. The threshold is adaptive per-namespace: a server that's been called in bursts recently gets more patience (up to +20) before it's unloaded, so heavily-used servers don't get torn down mid-task. Long-idle servers still unload at the baseline.

## `.mcph/` config directory

mcph stores its config under a `.mcph/` directory — mirroring the `.git/`, `.vscode/`, `.claude/` convention so everything related to mcph (config, project guide, future additions) lives under one predictable folder you can grep, gitignore, or blow away atomically. mcph reads `config.json` from three optional locations (highest precedence first):

| Scope | Path | Holds |
|-------|------|-------|
| **local** | `<project>/.mcph/config.local.json` | Machine-local override; `gitignore` it. Token allowed. |
| **project** | `<project>/.mcph/config.json` | Shared with the team via git. Token NOT allowed (warned). |
| **global** | `~/.mcph/config.json` | Personal default for every project. Token allowed. |

The project `.mcph/` is found by walking UP from the current directory until a `.mcph/` is found, stopping just before `$HOME` (exclusive) so a `.mcph/` sitting at `$HOME` is treated as user-global only and never double-loaded as project.

Full schema:

```jsonc
{
  // Schema version. mcph >= 0.11 emits version 1; older fields stay
  // readable. Newer versions log a warning so an old mcph can't silently
  // miss new fields.
  "version": 1,

  // Personal access token from mcp.hosting → Settings → API Tokens.
  // env MCPH_TOKEN still wins over the file value.
  "token": "mcp_pat_your_token_here",

  // API base override — point mcph at a self-hosted backend or staging.
  // Defaults to https://mcp.hosting. env MCPH_URL still wins.
  "apiBase": "https://mcp.hosting",

  // Project profile: which namespaces are allowed.
  "servers": ["gh", "pg", "linear"],

  // Project profile: namespaces denied even if in `servers`.
  "blocked": ["prod-db"]
}
```

**Comments are allowed** (line `//` and block `/* … */`) — handy for documenting a shared `config.json` checked into git.

**Resolution:**

- **Token** — `MCPH_TOKEN` env > local > global. (`token` in the project file is ignored and warned: it'd get committed to git.)
- **apiBase** — `MCPH_URL` env > local > project > global > `https://mcp.hosting`.
- **servers** allow-list — local wins if set, else project, else global (most-specific scope overrides).
- **blocked** deny-list — UNION across every scope that sets it (fail-safe on deny).
- Malformed files log a warning and fall through — fail-open so a typo doesn't brick the session.
- On POSIX, mcph warns if the file contains a token and is readable by group/other; run `chmod 600 ~/.mcph/config.json` to silence it.

**Token rotation**: mcph reads its config at startup. After editing `~/.mcph/config.json`, restart the MCP client (or kill mcph; the client respawns it).

`mcp_connect_health` shows which file(s) are currently applied.

## Project guide — `MCPH.md`

Drop a `MCPH.md` next to `config.json` inside either `.mcph/` and mcph surfaces its contents to your client via an `mcph://guide` MCP resource. The meta-tool descriptions (`discover`, `dispatch`) tell the model to read this resource first, so project-specific routing conventions ("use the `gh` server for GitHub, not bash") and credential guidance ("keys go in the dashboard, not `.mcp.json`") stick without the user restating them every session.

| Scope | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **user** | `~/.mcph/MCPH.md` | Personal defaults that apply everywhere (your preferred tools, credential conventions). |
| **project** | `<project>/.mcph/MCPH.md` | Project-specific guidance shared via git (which servers are load-bearing, project idioms). |

When both exist, the project guide is appended after the user guide with a `---` separator so project-specific rules get the final word in the reader's attention. A missing or empty file is silently skipped — if neither file exists, the `mcph://guide` resource isn't listed at all.

## Elicitation for missing credentials

When a server fails to start with stderr like `GITHUB_TOKEN is required` and your client advertises the MCP [elicitation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/server/elicitation) capability, mcph prompts you for the missing value inline and retries the load. Values stay in-memory for the current mcph session only — persist them in the mcp.hosting dashboard if you want them across restarts.

### Test from the dashboard

The `/dashboard/connect` page in mcp.hosting has a **Test** button per server that loads it through your running mcph and shows pass/fail inline — no LLM round-trip needed. Useful when you've just added a server and want to confirm the token works without prompting your AI.

### Errors come with deep-links

When a load fails (missing token, runtime not on PATH, server crashes on init), mcph emits a message ending with `→ Edit at https://mcp.hosting/dashboard/connect#server-<id>`. Most LLMs render that as a clickable link, and the dashboard scrolls to and highlights the matching card so you find the right server in one click.

## Config sync

mcph polls [mcp.hosting](https://mcp.hosting) every 60 seconds for config changes. When you add, remove, or modify a server on the dashboard, mcph picks it up automatically — no restart needed.

### Multi-device sync

Because every mcph install reads the same account's server list, the same token gives you the same servers across every machine. Install mcph on a second laptop with the same `mcp_pat_...`, and within 60 seconds it sees the same GitHub/Slack/Stripe/etc. servers you configured from the first. Tokens, environment variables, and credentials stay in the dashboard — you don't have to sync a JSON file across machines, copy secrets into a dotfile repo, or re-paste an API key per device.

Rotate a credential in one place (the dashboard), every machine picks up the new value on the next poll. Revoke a token in Settings → API Tokens, every install stops working immediately (the token is the only thing authenticating the config pull). This is why `~/.mcph/config.json` holds a token, not a server list — the server list is the cloud's concern.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `MCPH_TOKEN` | Yes (or in `~/.mcph/config.json`) | Personal access token from mcp.hosting. Env wins over `~/.mcph/config.json`. |
| `MCPH_URL` | No | API URL (default: `https://mcp.hosting`). Env wins over `apiBase` in `config.json`. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | Log verbosity: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` (default: `info`) |
| `MCPH_POLL_INTERVAL` | No | Config-poll interval in seconds. `0` disables polling (config fetched once at startup). Default: `60` |
| `MCPH_AUTO_ACTIVATE` | No | When `discover` is called with a context string and one server clearly wins, auto-load it. Set to `0` to disable. Default: enabled |
| `MCPH_SERVER_CAP` | No | Hard cap on concurrently activated servers. Default: `6`. Set to `0` to disable. |
| `MCPH_PRUNE_RESPONSES` | No | Conservative response pruning (redact large file blobs etc. before returning to the client). Set to `0` or `false` to disable. Default: enabled. |
| `MCPH_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE` | No | Set to `1` or `true` to keep learning + pack-history scoped to the current process — nothing loaded at start, nothing written on shutdown. Intended for ephemeral / shared environments (CI, containers). Default: cross-session persistence enabled at `~/.mcph/state.json`. |
| `MCPH_AUTO_LOAD` | No | Set to `1` or `true` to pre-activate the top recurring pack (from persisted pack-history) on startup — no LLM round-trip required. Skips silently when history is empty or no pack's namespaces are all installed. Default: off. Requires persistence to be enabled. |
| `MCPH_MIN_COMPLIANCE` | No | Minimum compliance grade (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, or `F`, case-insensitive) an installed server must report before `mcp_connect_activate` will load it. Ungraded servers always pass (don't punish unknown). `discover()` annotates below-grade servers in place and shows a "Compliance filter active" header when set. Invalid values log a warning and disable the filter. Default: unset (no filter). |
| `MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | No | Connection timeout in ms for upstream servers (default: `15000`) |
| `MCP_CONNECT_IDLE_THRESHOLD` | No | Baseline for idle auto-unload (default: `10`). The per-namespace adaptive cap is `[5, 50]` — bursty namespaces extend past the baseline, long-idle ones unload at it. |

## Runtime detection

On startup, mcph probes your machine for `node`, `npx`, `python`, `uvx`, and `docker` and reports the snapshot to mcp.hosting. The dashboard uses this to warn before you add a catalog server whose runtime isn't installed (e.g., adding the Sentry server when Python isn't on your PATH). No prompt, no LLM round-trip — just a yellow banner on the Add Server form.

The detection is best-effort: each probe has a 3-second timeout and missing runtimes are recorded as absent rather than blocking startup. mcph itself only requires Node.js — every other runtime is optional and only matters for servers that need it.

### Automatic `uv` bootstrap

The popular Python-based MCP servers (`sqlite`, `time`, `sentry`, and other uvx-launched entries) all launch via Astral's `uv`/`uvx`. mcph ships its own bootstrap for these: on first encounter with a `uv`/`uvx` command, if the binary isn't on your PATH, mcph lazily downloads Astral's standalone `uv` release, verifies the sha256, and caches it under the platform-appropriate cache dir. Subsequent loads reuse the cached binary. If you already have `uv` installed, mcph uses your version and never downloads.

`uvx ARGS` is always rewritten to `uv tool run ARGS` at spawn time — so only `uv` needs to be reachable, not `uvx` separately. Fixes Windows setups where one was on PATH and the other wasn't.

## Trust & security

MCP servers are third-party code that you choose to run, and mcph launches them on your machine or calls them over the network. We don't sandbox arbitrary code and we're not an antivirus — that's your OS and network. What mcph gives you is **visibility and a gate**:

- **Compliance grades (A–F)** — the `@yawlabs/mcp-compliance` suite runs 88 behavioral tests against an MCP server and reports a grade. mcp.hosting publishes grades for catalog servers; `mcph servers` shows them, and `mcp_connect_discover` surfaces them inline on every listing (e.g., `github — GitHub [ready] [A]`). Set `MCPH_MIN_COMPLIANCE=B` (or any grade) and `mcp_connect_activate` will refuse to load anything below the floor — the refusal message spells out the grade and the env var to unset. Ungraded servers always pass (don't punish unknown), so audit unknowns yourself with `mcph compliance <target>` before you rely on them.
- **Source transparency** — `mcph servers` and the mcp.hosting dashboard show the exact `command`, `args`, and `url` each server launches with. Nothing is hidden or wrapped — if a server is `npx -y @example/foo` you see that, and you can trace it back to npm / GitHub / the remote endpoint before installing.
- **Credentials stay encrypted at rest on mcp.hosting** — API tokens and other secrets you paste into a server's `env` block are encrypted on the backend and injected at spawn time. They don't sit in a committed `.env` file or a client config JSON, and they are never logged. Revoke the mcp.hosting token (Settings → API Tokens) and every install loses access on the next poll.
- **Response pruning** — `MCPH_PRUNE_RESPONSES` (on by default) redacts large file-blob-shaped content before it reaches your LLM. This cuts the easiest form of cross-server prompt injection (stuffing a giant payload into a tool reply to swamp the model's context) and reduces accidental token burn. Set to `0` to disable.
- **Namespace isolation** — tools are namespace-prefixed (`gh_create_issue`, never bare `create_issue`), so a server can't impersonate tools from another server it has no business touching. `mcp_connect_read_tool` lets you inspect a tool's schema without loading its server, so you can decide before any code runs.

**What mcph does not try to solve.** mcph does not prevent a server you deliberately installed from doing harmful things inside its own process. It doesn't block outbound network traffic, firewall DNS, analyze source, or pin package hashes. A malicious server you chose to run can call any URL your machine can reach; cross-server prompt injection through tool output is a fundamentally model-layer problem that no orchestrator fully fixes. The defenses that matter for those threats live at the layer below mcph:

- Review the command (`npx -y @scope/pkg`, a remote URL, …) before adding a server. If you don't recognize it, run `mcph compliance <target>` against it first.
- Run mcph and its spawned servers under a restricted OS user or inside a container if you're handling sensitive data. mcph stays out of your sandbox's way — a restricted user will block egress just like it would for anything else.
- Keep the mcp.hosting token scoped to the devices that need it. Rotate with `mcph install <client> --token …`; every client picks up the new value.
- Prefer graded servers when the alternatives are otherwise equivalent. A server that can't pass the compliance suite on basic spec conformance is a worse choice than one that does.

If you find a security issue in mcph itself, email `support@mcp.hosting` — details in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
