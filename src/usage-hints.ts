//   1. Success count from LearningStore — "you called this N times
//      and it worked." Populated by dispatch's post-call success
//      tracking. Manual `activate` calls don't contribute.
//
//   2. Co-activation peers from PackDetector — "when you loaded X
//      you usually had Y loaded too." Populated by successful proxied
//      tool calls across ≥2 distinct namespaces within a short gap.
//
// Both signals persist across mcph restarts via ~/.mcph/state.json
// (see persistence.ts) so a freshly-started session still knows which
// servers the user has been relying on. Counts reflect cumulative
// successful use since persistence started, not just the live process.
// Set MCPH_DISABLE_PERSISTENCE=1 to keep signals session-local only.

// Cap on peers per hint. Keeps the discover() line length bounded —
// more than ~3 peers quickly drowns out the rest of the server card.

// entry for namespace N lists every OTHER namespace that appeared in
// any pack containing N.

// Output is sorted + deduped so rendering is stable across calls even
