// Smart-routing quality gate. Pre-launch exercise from the launch TODO:
// "run mcp_connect_dispatch with 10 varied English intents against a
// seeded 15-server config; verify the top-ranked server is correct or
// within top-3 in all cases."
//
// This file runs the BM25 side of that check — no Voyage rerank, so it
// tests the *floor* of ranking quality (what every user sees even when
// the backend rerank key is missing or the call times out). If this
// suite stays green across refactors, dispatch never regresses below
// the lexical baseline.
//
// The benchmark is deliberately a unit test, not a live-backend
// integration test, so it runs in CI without a Voyage key.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// Realistic seed of 15 MCP servers drawn from the mcp.hosting catalog.
// Descriptions + tool metadata match what the dashboard surfaces, which
// is what the ranker actually sees in production.
